# Daylio

Daylio is a mood tracking and journaling app focused on mental, emotional and physical health. It is not super complicated although I find the screens can be a little crowded/overwhelming.

## Super awesome maybe we should use/implement
* bottom navigation bar
* most stats are shareable(pulls up native iOS sharing), sends default message with app website link and pic

## Interesting
* stores all data locally with option to backup to cloud
* very simple (couple clicks) mood tracking/journal entry
* stats incl. streak tracker, mood chart, achievements
* advanced stats (premium option)

## I don't like that
* ads, popups, notifications to push premium/paid version

# Moodpath

Monitoring and self-management for mental health disorders 

## Super awesome maybe we should use/implement
* initial questionnaire very soon after opening app with progress bar on top, yes/no questions with how much does this burden you

## Interesting
* integrates with Apple Health data
* asks when you get up in the morning for notifications
* psych courses and guided meditation (some free, some paid)

## I don't like that
* Moodpath plus subscription through iTunes/Apple account
* first time you open there's an automated text chat which leads to consent, jumps back to text chat after first few questions
* need 14 days of assessment for results (asks for 3 times a day)
* calendar, 3 bars for 3 daily assesments looks funny

# Wysa

AI mental health chat bot

## Super awesome maybe we should use/implement

## Interesting
* list of challenges when first opening app
* link to therapists
* SOS button

## I don't like that
* referral code?
* therapist option always shows up even if I have said I am not interested
* Help in chat is just general help, not specific to what you are doing
* chat seems iffy
* not intuitive that you can scroll in some menus

# Mindshift

Canadian anxiety tool

## Super awesome maybe we should use/implement

## Interesting
* location based links to local mental health institutions
* share option is CSV through email

## I don't like that
* asks for notifications first time you open
* forced to create account
* no introduction, tutorial
* buttons hard to click
* wordy, so many walls of text

# Youper

pocket AI chat

## Super awesome maybe we should use/implement
* wordmap format with single words and colours
* asks if it would like to schedule a suggested activity, gives a list of options

## Interesting
* silly/humorous response options
* unsure options which give more information
* regularly checks in to give a chance to end conversation
* much better responses than Wysa
* stats connected to specific keywords
* muted colour scheme
* meditation and sleep help

## I don't like that
* shows you premium conversation to get you to subscribe
* percentage ratings of feelings, can only select one at a time

# Motivation type apps

# Fabulous

science based self-care app

## Super awesome maybe we should use/implement
* journey design, animation, videos, very high production
* achievements, gamification, next tasks greyed out until unlocked
* quick links to discover images with simple infographics/checklists

## Interesting

## I don't like that
* I think I was forced to sign up for a free premium trial, or I just didn't figure out a way around it

# Motivate

quotes/videos

* first ones are "pro" locked, slow load times, flashing quotes which are hard to read
* very high production value, most things are locked, hard to get a good read, wide ranging
* nothing we could really use here

# Way of Life

## Super awesome maybe we should use/implement
* opening screen recommends interactive walk though or nah, just get me started button

## Interesting
* colours days just red/green for if you did an activity
* ability to change graphs for own preference (add a trend line, change time frame etc.)

## I don't like that
* free version limited to 3 items
* confusing nav bar 
* confusing top menu bar buttons

# Streaks

## Super awesome maybe we should use/implement
* haptic feedback

## Interesting
* very simple design, tasks where you add task and just hold to complete it for the day. Goal is just to go on a long streak of doing the activity

## I don't like that
* might not be very motivating if you break a long streak and start back at 0

## general notes
A lot of habit tracking apps, affirmations/quotes type apps
some newer apps will let you add widgets now to homescreen with new iOS update (possibility for us)
