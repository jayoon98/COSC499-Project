## Remote Session with Brandon Gaucher

[https://youtu.be/loL3OQAcgn4](video)
Asked Brandon to tell me where to click as we had issues with Chrome

Circles visualization:

- issues with clicking on small circles/rings
- didn't press buttons at top, even after explaining we added them
- clicked around on everything, said he liked the visuals
- "What does prioritize domain mean?"
- asked if the bar at the bottom was part of the app or emulator (wasn't clear that it was a nav bar)

Questionnaires:

- wasn't clear how to start a questionnaire, or the fact that you could do more than one at the same time by clicking multiple and hitting begin
- scoring system for questions was not clear, he wasn't sure if he should be happy about "fear of being alone"

Calendar:

- liked the calendar, knew it was activities, but that was prompted by me saying view an activity on the calendar

Settings:

- seemed to understand to click the x to change the theme to that list, but didn't get into detail on it

## Thinkaloud session with Adam Collins

Technical fail, my recording didn't work.

Circles visualization:

- explored by clicking the circles first, mentioning how the colours and text changed in the main box below. Clicked each bottom button in order. Had no idea who the quote of the day was by (neither did I)
- commented on the nav bar right away saying things didn't highlight when you pressed them. Also thought the 3rd one (calendar) was a shopping bag
- didn't press buttons at top

Questionnaires:

- also had trouble figuring out how to start a questionnaire. Asked if begin was a domain or what it did. Needed to explain that you could select multiple questionnaires and hit begin to start.
- ended up selecting 3 questionnaires, but got through 14/27 questions and asked how he could get out. He would have to go back 14 times or finish the last 13 questions in order to get out of the questionnaire.
- Had no trouble going to edit a questionnaire, but didn't find it intuitive that he was just brought into a "previously completed" questionnaire

Calendar:

- seemed to be clear and make sense to him

Settings:

- didn't like the x's to select the theme, that didn't make sense to him.
- wasn't sure how to exit out of the themes page, but did ask to try and swipe left fairly quickly. Commented that a general back button might be helpful for many areas of the app.

Mentioned again that it bother him that the nav bar left and right buttons didn't highlight when you were on those pages.
