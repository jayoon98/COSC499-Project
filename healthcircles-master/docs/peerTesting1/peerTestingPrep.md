# Description of System
The Health Circles mobile app encourages users to have a holistic view of their own mental health. Users answer questions to quantifiably describe their well-being in several different domains (physical, mental, emotional, social, spiritual) which are represented visually as concentric circles of varying sizes. Based on their results, users are recommended activities to add to their calendar to improve their well-being.

# Current Features
Users answer the initial health questionnaire, preferably doing all 5 domains (social, emotional, mental, physical, and spiritual).
- Users can choose which domains to do the questionnaire for
- Users answer questions to rank aspects of each domain (eg sleep for the physical domain) on a scale of 1-7

Users can view circle visualizations
- The visualizations consist of concentric circles representing each health domain
- The size of each circle correlates with their wellbeing in each domain
- The visualizations are static design elements at this phase, not generated from user data

Users can access a calendar within the app which shows the dates of scheduled activities and when domains were updated.
- They can view the calendar populated with test activity data, but cannot add, edit, or remove items

Users navigate the app with a bottom navigation menu
- They can tap buttons to jump directly to the calendar, questionnaires, stats/visualizations, and account/settings
- Standard back to previous screen button

Users can view colour schemes for each health domain, but cannot switch them at this stage

## Features Not Included/Known Bugs
- No questions exist for the Spiritual domain. If only that domain is selected for a questionnaire, the app will crash.
- Several buttons are clickable but have no effect. On the Circles page, the "Suggested Acitivities" and "Prioritize Domain" buttons. On the Questionnaires page, the pencil icon to edit past surveys. On the Edit Theme page (under Settings), the "X" buttons to select themes.
