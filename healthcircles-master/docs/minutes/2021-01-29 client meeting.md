online meeting (Collaborate Ultra)
minutes recorded by Michael

## Attendees

- Michael Crouse
- Dr. Kim Dawson

## Agenda

- Explore new format for circles page

## Notes

- I reminded Dr. Dawson about the feedback we received about the circles page. I said we would like to redesign it. He quickly sketched a pie chart and said here's an option, but he would like to avoid it. I showed him the options we had sketched out, and we agreed to try the stack.
- we talked about the copy he sent for the different domains. He mentioned it was very important that crisis info is included somewhere in the app, and that the majority of the info makes it in somewhere. It would be ok if it was shortened a bit or edited.

## Action Items

- meeting next week
- implement the circles stack and show Dr. Dawson
