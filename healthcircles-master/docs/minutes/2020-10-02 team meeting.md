## Sprint Retrospective
- what the team did well:
	- we were able to get gitstats to work!
	- team is communicating well and working well together
- what the team can improve on:
	- when reviewing pull request, do not approve and comment (only comment) or gitstats does not see it
- kudos to a team member for a specific accomplishment:
	- Michael for reading gitstats code to understand how dates work

## Main Takeaways from Client Meeting
- diagrams will be used to prototype (not the bar chart)
- is it possible to schedule a meeting with just Kim and our team (especially when presenting prototype)?
- need to work with the pdf Kim put together - update functional requirements
- Kim wants people to be able to take a selfie in the app
- user progress reports based on taking questionnaire multiple times
- collecting data for psych research
