## Agenda

## Notes
* Dr. Dawson liked the space and directness of the app draft design, was concerned about hard edges and lack of circles/colour
* he responded that his surveys take 20 minutes and 5-10 minutes to complete
* he asked and emphasized he would like to see avatars, ability for people to take pictures of themselves to have their likeness in an avatar
* he mentioned a Netflix documentary, The Social Dilemma, that he watched and recommended we all see. He went to humanetech.com from this film and read and filled out a design guide from it, which he shared and forwarded to us. His priority with the app is to help people, not profit, although he wouldn't mind making some money from it.
