# Client Meeting 23 October 2020
online meeting (Collaborate Ultra)
minutes recorded by Michael


## Attendees
 - Michael Crouse
 - Meredith Lister
 - Dr. Kim Dawson

## Agenda
* New 20 mins split meeting with individual groups vs combined group meeting
* Updated look/feel review with Dr. Dawson

## Notes
* Kim commented on text in look/feel prototype, I mentioned it was mostly placeholder text, was nowhere near final, we would continue to work on it
* He mentioned multiple times he would like to use the words improve health or something similar
* He brought up that he would like to do a motivation questionnaire after users are shown their visualization. He will provide the survey
* The motivation questionnaire would be done specific to their chosen domain, and if users had a low motivation to work on that domain, they would be redirected to choose a different domain. An option I mentioned was that number of activities, or which activities recommended could be based on their motivation responses.
* Discussed user groups, decided to shift more to Dr. Dawson client user focus vs general public


## Action Items 
* Meet again Oct 30 3PM
* Review apps/literature on motivation (Michael)
