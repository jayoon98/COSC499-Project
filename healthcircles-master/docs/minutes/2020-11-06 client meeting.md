# Client Meeting 6 November 2020

online meeting (Collaborate Ultra)
minutes recorded by Michael

## Attendees

- Michael Crouse
- Dr. Kim Dawson

## Agenda

- motivation apps/research review

## Notes

- Talked about the social dilemma and netflix and their auto playing next shows
- brought up the motivation research and apps. Focused on the one list in motivation research notes. Mentioned gamification as a strong presence through a lot of what I read, Kim talked about avatars and getting rewards/accessories for your avatar as something to do this with.
- Talked about intrinsic/extrinsic motivation. Avatars would provide extrinsic motivation but we need to ensure the app is building intrinsic motivation as best we can. Kim talked about including some information regarding this in the app.
- Should include "the right" amount of information/intelligence. Likely a few paragraphs, probably behind a click of a button provided where users can access more information regarding this domain/activity and how it might help
- Kim said he is still thinking/working on introduction information and how he would like to present the app to new users

## Action Items

- no meeting next week, meet again Nov 20
