- Short title of survey questions is too short, user needs to click info.
- Login page password too short has no error message
- Average does not account for the fact that they can improve
- Expo kept reloading and having the fixed downloading javascript bar (not sure we can fix this)
- Adding a new activity causes the keyboard to stay open and the hide the confirm button. The only way to close the keyboard is to press `return` on the keyboard.
- Jinyang was part of our previous peer testing, he mentioned that the new circles page design is much more clear.

- Adding to google calender
- Score was not clear, what do they mean
- Upon looking at the app they didn’t know what each button did but figured out once we got to each page. I don’t think this is an issue since the user can discover it quite easily.
- Themes button crashed the app
- Overall Nathan had very positive things to say about the app’s design.
