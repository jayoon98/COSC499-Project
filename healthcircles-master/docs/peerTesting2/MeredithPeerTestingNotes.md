- went to calendar to schedule a reminder
- had trouble finding questionnaires -> went to circle tab first
- crashed after pressing begin button with "spiritual" and "physical" domains
- white text for activity was interpreted as "I need to retype the text"
- tried to reach full calendar by clicking calendar icon, then person (settings page), then clicking through other tabs
- referred to settings page as profile page
