## Remote Session with Kathryn Lecha

Kat was having issues seeing the screen changes on Chrome Remote Desktop. I switched to sharing my screen and asked her to tell me where to click.

Run on Android emulator

- Noticed no confirmation for setting the daily notification
- Edit activity on Android didn't work (because of date format I think)
- Kat commented on the white background + black text, she said it wasn't aesthetically pleasing (or more bluntly, it hurt her eyes)
- theme and logout buttons have no spacing on profile page
- Kat recommended we show the way to select questionnaires in the tutorial. She said starting a questionnaire wasn't intuitive, but it did make sense and she liked it once she figured it out.
- she also mentioned there was no reference point for the scores on circles page, it wasn't clear the numbers were scores and she thought they were out of 10

## Thinkaloud session with Jennifer Mclean

Run on iPhone XR using LetsView, shared screen through Discord

- No AM/PM on daily notification options (realized the switch to 24hrs went to the master branch and I was running off PT2)
- No confirmation/notice when you have completed a questionnaire or edited one
- tabs on circles page are hard to see (partially a letsview/discord issue, looks more transparent than on my phone)
- need to click twice on date/time to edit it, plus no confirm button, need to click off again to save it, this was confusing for her
- overall Jennifer liked it, she said she wasn't sure about the nav bar and getting around, but figured it out on the first try each time so it makes enough sense
