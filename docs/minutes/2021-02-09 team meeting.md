# Team Meeting 9 February 2021
## Sprint Retrospective & Progress Updates
Michael:
- suggesting and adding multiple actiivites at once would take a lot of time
- on circles page, display single suggested activity. user can tap that to jump to "add activity" page with activity title/description filled out. user can select date and time as usual.
- added the info and strategies from Dr Dawson. still need to add links from him.
- edit activities is working

- currently uses `toLocaleString`, we need to provide a custom format so that it's the same all the time
