## Agenda

- Questions re: client feedback

- review peer testing feedback and what came up

## Notes

- Dr. Dawson shared (again) that he was confused when certain terminolgy is used (specifically front end/back end) and what exactly that meant. He is not a technical person and still does not understand what this means even though it has been explained to him a few times.
- He expressed interest in (re) meeting other team members, and getting a few sentences on who they are and what they have been working on. We said we could try and make that work for people who are available during next meeting times.
- He is happy with progress, and different versions of the product. He mentioned how the mobile app presentation is very different from the web app
- He would like to ensure that the app is made "as interesting and engaging as we can."
- He expressed interest in having some basic sound effects, things like a cheer for completing a questionnaire
- He also mentioned he would like to ensure there is an option or way to connect with "your therapist" within/through the app

## Action Items

- Next meetings Wed Jan 20th and 29th at Noon
