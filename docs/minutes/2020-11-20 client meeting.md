# Client Meeting 20 November 2020

online meeting (Collaborate Ultra)
minutes recorded by Michael

## Attendees

- Michael Crouse
- Dr. Kim Dawson

## Agenda

- review app current state/progress

## Notes

- Kim is thinking of adding a 6th domain, ecological. Said it isn't necessarily something he would like us to implement. I said we could add it to the end of our list if we have time
- He commented on looking for a list of activities similar to the list of quotes I found, instead of having to create a list. I said I could look into it
- Kim commented on the format of the questionnaires page, that the begin button looks like another domain and it's a little confusing. We talked through options and said maybe move it, maybe change wording, maybe leave it and make sure it's clear in instructions/tutorial.
- Kim commented on editing previous surveys, that ideally the edit button would bring up a list of answers to the completed questionnaire, and then an option to edit it

## Action Items

- meet again next week Nov 27
