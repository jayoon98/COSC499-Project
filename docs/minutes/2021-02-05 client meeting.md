# Client Meeting 5 February 2021

online meeting (Collaborate Ultra)
minutes recorded by Michael

## Attendees

- Michael Crouse
- Dr. Kim Dawson

## Agenda

- review current app progress

## Notes

- I showed Dr. Dawson the updated circles page with the vertically stacked circles. He really liked the new look.
- Dr. Dawson mentioned/asked about some type of progress measurement for users of the app. This is something we seem to have lost track of and really should implement. He mentioned it would be interesting to be able to select the domain and have a sequence of circles of different sizes to show the changing scores over time.
- We noticed editing questionnaires was broken. Need to ask Lucas about this.
- He asked about calendar integration with google/icloud. I mentioned we didn't have plans to implement this.

## Action Items

- next meeting Feb 12th
- ask Lucas about editing questionnaires
