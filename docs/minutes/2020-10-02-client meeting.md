## Notes
* After the first question/comment from Michael, about the circles and overlapping, Kim shared some more documents regarding his thoughts/analysis of the app and his plan (he doesn't like the bar chart). Circles were to be concentric (Michael does not think this will work very well). Kim would also like the ability to click on the circles as buttons (to link where?)
* Kim has not done any research/exploration of other available mobile apps
* Michael asked about a one liner for the app, something for him to think about as the main goal. "An app to..." Later in meeting Kim responded this would be "An app to improve your (overall) health"
* A question was asked about babushka dolls and 2d prints of circles. Kim would like users to be able to take a (3D) picture/selfie that could be printed on a nesting doll.
* YourHealthApp file to be used as main reference for requirements from Dr. Dawson
* Research purpose as secondary function for app
* HealthCircles app name is still main thought
* User progress reports would be a nice feature
