# Description of the Software

The Health Circles mobile site encourages users to have a holistic view of their own mental health. Users answer questions to quantifiably describe their well-being in several different domains (physical, mental, emotional, social, spiritual) which are represented visually as overlapping circles. Based on their results, users are recommended activities to add to their calendar to improve their well-being. Admins may add new questions or activity suggestions over time.
