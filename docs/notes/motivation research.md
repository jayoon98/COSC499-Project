"This research attempts to understand the complicated and context-sensitive topic of fitness tracking apps UX by examining the influence of user motivation and perceived self-efficacy during use"

UX Heuristics for fitness trackers (seems applicable for our purposes)

1. Level of personalization: Default goal-setting for most users/most occasions; let the user decide what is desirable without making necessary restrictions imposing a hinder or the desired outcome/activity performance level.
2. Navigation/input: Provide a starting point for personalization features; a clear way to show that there are options/further ways of personalizing single functions. Gamification of the process of navigating and personalizing is critical.
3. Positive Feedback: Provide feedback that motivation and/or self-efficacy level has changed through user-defined ratings and questionnaires; system to provide new goals based on the user reported or system-defined motivation level; provide boundaries for motivation and self-efficacy to support users in their activity and needs; expose users to positive and constructive feedback that seems to promote greater motivation—a finding contrary to [46] study.
4. Multi-activity motivation analysis: Users expressed a desire for features that enable them to better analyse relations between data/information—activities and motivation/self-efficacy behaviour, e.g., between sleep/diet and high or low motivation. Users may be able to categorize activities based on the motivation or self-efficacy improvements they see, as well as to explore behaviours that promote higher motivation or increased self-efficacy.
5. Context integration: Capturing reflections on life events and emotional [47] or social interactions during fitness tracking may be an important facilitator of motivation and self-efficacy. This can create an added sense of sociability [48] or social UX known to drive healing, motivation behaviour change in healthcare [49].
6. Provide intelligence to encourage more targeted behaviour change: Giving users a means to explore their gathered data to increase their self-efficacy and fitness levels, can make the experience more meaningful. Interpreted data can be helpful (like SmartCoach in the Jawbone app) but making sense of activity trends and patterns and tying those to “victories” or self-defined goals might improve self-efficacy.
7. Sustain user motivation by leveraging intrinsic motivation into a playful experience: Use game elements and small rewards to support different stages of self-monitoring; thus it is possible to meet user needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness that support the development of intrinsic motivation [50].


## The role of health-care providers in mHealth adoption

1. health tech rarely recommended by health care providers in practice
2. providers want to see stamp of approval from health organization before recommending
