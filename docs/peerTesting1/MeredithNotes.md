Circles visualization:
- "I feel like I don't know what I'm looking at"
- why are the circles different colours? Why do they overlap/disappear when you click them?
- info box is cut off on smaller screens

Questionnaires:
- next and previous buttons are cut off, making it impossible to complete survey
- datetime format looks different on Android
- user immediately pressed the correct button when asked to edit the survey, but the button didn't work

Calendar:
- liked the page layout, but wasn't sure how to add activities (the feature is not implemented yet)

Settings:
- user tried to click the entire theme bar at first, not the button on the left
- thought that the X's on buttons were confusing: suggested a radio bubble instead

- Didn't try to interact with the labels or the circles themselves on Circles page
- Looked on Circles page for option to change theme
- Had a hard time seeing icons on bottom bar (contrast is much lower on computer monitor)
- Tried to select one colour from each row of themes, expected colour to show up on the left after being selected
- Wasn't sure how to leave theme page: suggested adding back arrows to indicate swipe left functionality
