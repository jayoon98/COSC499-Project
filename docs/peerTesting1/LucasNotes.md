Circles

- Confusion about what the circles mean
- Tapping on the top bar selecting domains selects the circle, confused why the other circles disappear sometimes.
  - What does each color mean when you select a domain
- Domain selection too small
- “I know the size [of the circles] represent the circles but I don’t know exactly how to interpret it.”
- Suggestion: Add explanation on how to interpret the data.
- “For me the most confusing part [of the app] is the circles. And that’s probably the essense of this app”

Questionnaires:

- How to begin a survey: Is `Begin` a domain?
  - Begin button should be in a different shape.
- Unsure of what editing a survey means
  - “Why do I want to do it [the survey] multiple times”
- Icons on the slider don’t make sense for all the questions
- Back button means go back to the previous question not back to the previous page

Activities

- Questionnaires don’t show up on calender.

Settings:

- What does the `X` button on the themes mean.
- Missing back button
- Is it better to just let the user choose their own colours instead of a predefined palette
  - Could have a problem where user chooses colours that don’t make sense.

Navigation:

- Icons are not clear.
- Some pages are highlighted in the navigation while some are not.

## Thinkaloud

This user is also in the Dawson group so the concept of the app was a lot more familiar to them.

Circles:

- Circles page is not highlighted in the navigation bar.
- What does the part at the bottom of the circles page mean.

Survey:

- What is the edit button on the surveys mean.
  - Why would I want to edit the survey.
- A survey can be completed by just pressing next repeatedly.
  - Not sure if we can fix this.

Activities

- How are the activities populated in the Calendar.
  - How are they chosen?
  - Maybe this should be explained to the user or it can be hidden.
- How often does is the user given a new activity.
  - Should the frequency in which new activities are added be configurable.
    - ie everyday, once every couple of days etc.
- What happens when you click on something without an activity?
  - Nothings happens.

Settings:

- Could you have a custom theme where the user selects their custom colours instead of the predefined one.
  - Like having a color picker.
