      <h3>INFORMATION</h3>
      This app asks you to rate yourself on measures of physical health. Several good measures of
      physical health are appetite, quality of sleep,
      exercise, level of energy, use of medication or
      other drugs, and physical illness.
      <br />
      Why is physical health important? The answer to this
      question is obvious, but here&apos;s one a lot
      of people don&apos;t consider. The importance of
      sleep. For example, when you lack sleep, you will
      tend to have lower energy and perhaps try to compensate by drinking more coffee or eat
      sugar to keep you stimulated. You might even use sleep aids to help you sleep but over the
      long run, medications are an artificial compensation for sleep hygiene or sleep hormones in
      trouble. When you get too much sleep, you will probably feel groggy during the day, or you
      might get a kink in your neck or back from lying around so long. Small fluctuations are
      common and help keep your mental and emotional health balanced. Large fluctuations in
      sleep are often seen in depressed people who sleep too much or not enough.
      <br />
      As you can see, sleep is vital for your well-being during the day. Like the other aspects of
      physical health like exercise and appetite, the
      physical acts of sleep, exercise, and eating can
      hugely impact other types of health that you want to improve.
    </p>

    <p>
      <h3>STRATEGIES</h3>
      A few strategies for improving sleep are:
      <br />
      • go to sleep at roughly the same time every night
      <br />
      • get exposure to light and exercise early in the day
      <br />

      <br />

      The central recommendation for all difficulties associated with health is to strive for
      moderation, balance, or harmony. There are several ways to do this. The upgraded version of
      this app being developed is to provide exercises which hinge around the harmony principle.
      <br />
      A practical recommendation that derives from harmony is appreciation of music and the arts.
      For example, while dealing with the death of a loved one or caring for a person who is ill,
      there is a risk of becoming overly absorbed and losing oneself, not focusing on anything else,
      and getting burned out. At that point, we become useless to the people we wish to care for.
      Appreciating music and the arts, such as singing,
      writing, painting, or graphic arts, all have a
      way of connecting us with a part of ourselves that is timeless, creative, and buoyant. For
      example, while dealing with death or grief, one suggestion is to read a humourous book about
      death such as Mort (Death&apos;s apprentice) by Terry Pratchett.

      <h3>INFORMATION</h3>
      One way of defining mental health is through measures like the ability to concentrate, solve
      problems, and communicate clearly and effectively. Another definition is the absence of
      mental illness. Perhaps a better definition includes the aspects of clarity of mind, solution-
      orientedness, and positive outlook on one&apos;s
      life, presence of mind, and motivation towards
      some social benefit or life purpose. Again, one health system or domain impacts the others.
      The ability to notice unintentional alterations of states of consciousness, such as dozing off
      (hopefully not “at the wheel”) or having nightmares
      or panic attacks, suggests the beginning of
      healing from these difficulties.

      Founded in psychological science, recommendations for improving mental health include:
      <br />
      • Deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation
      <br />
      • Mindfulness meditation (as in Tara Brach&apos;s amazing guided meditation collection)
      <br />
      • Floating
      <br />
      • Positive psychology tools
      <br />
      • Explorations of how the body&apos;s energy changes and heals from skillful touch (as in
      physiotherapy, massage, chiropractic, integrative energy healing, etc.)
      <br />
      • Emotional attunement (as in couple&apos;s relationships)
      <br />
      • Novel technologies (as in MUSE)

    <p>
      <h3>INFORMATION</h3>
      Several ways to measure emotional health are feelings such as anxiety, compassion,
      happiness, anger, empathy, joy, sorrow, creativity, grief, and love. Primary emotions are fear
      and sadness. These are often expressed as disappointment, humiliation, and anxiety. For
      most people, negative emotions are often triggered by traumatic experiences, while positive
      emotions are brought about by feeling appreciated or valued. We are trained to avoid negative
      emotions very early in life. Parents or teachers tell us not to cry or try to make us not
      be so upset by telling us, “Oh, it&apos;s not so bad
      as that!” Trouble is, they are missing the
      point. These comments are invalidating. Research has shown that invalidating environments can
      cause psychological injury. The more invalidating, the more injury is caused.
      <br />
      Human development means we change as we move from conception through birth,
      childhood, teen and adult years, towards death. Change can be scary. But it can also be
      exciting. One way to cope with anxiety is to recognize
      that it represents the impulse to fear a
      threatening situation. But that threat is a perception. Just because social anxiety is the
      second most common fear second only to death
      doesn&apos;t mean we can&apos;t use it to our advantage.
      Social anxiety ties in with almost every other type of fear – of being judged by others, of
      being talked about by others behind our backs, and trying to deny our humanity and appear
      perfectly free of mistakes. What&apos;s worse is
      we&apos;ll die being judged and talked about by others
      or being eaten by a tiger.
    </p>

    <p>
      <h3>STRATEGIES</h3>
      • Educate yourself about the effects of invalidation
      <br />
      • Is that really a tiger? Consider whether the situation is really as threatening as we think
      it is.
      <br />
      • Seek positive things in the situation.
      <br />
      • Write your own epitaph – what do you want people to remember you for?
      <br />
      • Remember your mindfulness skills, notice the negative story floating away on a cloud.
      <br />
      • Don&apos;t get caught up in the story
      <br />
      • Journal all the positive things that happened today
      <br />
      • List 5 things you are grateful for
      <br />
      • Define a path of your own, even if others disagree
      <br />
      • Get other people&apos;s views of your troubles by sharing them with people you trust
      <br />

      <h3>INFORMATION</h3>
      We touched on the overlap of social health with the emotional health circle. This is evident
      in social anxiety. Other measures of social health include: how we feel about our close
      relationships, how well we get along and can depend on family members, and how well we
      socialize with people outside our close relationships and family.
      All these areas of social health have importance, especially when we are alone. Being alone
      can be just fine, as we do need some time to ourselves, for a sense of independence and to
      learn who we are inside. But when being alone starts to feel lonely, research has shown a
      higher risk of death. The explanation for this is unclear and research is being done to help
      understand the link between loneliness and mortality. Clearly, there is a yearning for
      connection with others, for helping one another, and to be helped and loved by others.
      Without that emotional and physical connection to those we trust moves us closer to losing
      the purpose of being part of the larger group that we hope would rally around us when we are
      ailing. Without that support, if we are very sick,
      it can get more and more difficult to do things
      on our own. We need one another.

    <p>
      <h3>STRATEGIES</h3>
      Asking oneself these questions are strategies to get us thinking and acting to improve our
      social health. How is your social health? Do you have regular and pleasant interactions with
      friends, family, and a spouse or beloved partner? Do you take part in community activities,
      such as volunteering or enjoying music with others? Do you have a job, go to school, or
      engage in learning new things from others? These are connections that can be very
      rewarding and bring balance to our self-time.
      <br />
      Other strategies include:
      <br />
      • Text, email, or call a friend and invite them to talk or to participate in some activity.
      Even online is better than no contact at all. At least you get to see them.
      <br />
      • Online or off, try for face-to-face contact.
      <br />
      • Get a dog! Dogs get us out walking or (if the dog is small) wheelchairing. They evoke
      chats between strangers, family, and friends alike about their mutual interest in dogs.
      Dog-owners have been shown in research to be generally healthier in all health
      domains. Dogs also encourage empathy, patience, and new learning – such as dog
      training skills.
      <br />
      • Notice feelings of avoidance, irritability, or resentment. Try to stay open to these
      feelings because suppressing them can perpetuate the cycle.
      <br />
      • Forgive others when they don&apos;t reply to you. Forgive them for having a life. They
      probably have other things on. Don&apos;t take other
      people&apos;s lives as an insult against you.
      <br />
      • Forgive yourself when you don&apos;t reply to others.
      Forgive yourself for having the life you do.
      <br />
      • Refer to recommendations in the mental, emotional, and social domains
      <br />
      • Exploring your positive feelings about someone can help you sort out how to repair the
      relationship. Write them down and remind yourself of them.
      <br />
      • Repair the relationship by reaching out and remember it&apos;s okay to have differing points
      of view. Start slowly and stay willing to talk it through.
      <br />
      • Try to reach understanding of the other&apos;s point of view. Don&apos;t focus on reaching
      agreement. Seek to understand how they came to this place and offer to listen to that.
      Ask them to do the same.
