How to score each question type (and calculate their maxScore/minScore)

MCC
------------
Score: Add weights of answers together. Map from (minScore, maxScore) to (-1, 1)
minScore: -1 * # of -1 weights
maxScore: # of 1 weights

MCR
------------
Score: Map answer from (minScore, maxScore) to (-1, 1)
minScore: Lowest weighted option
maxScore: Highest weighted option

Ranking
------------
Score: For each option, multiply weight by (n-i), where n is the total number of options minus 1, and i is the current index (starting at 0). Add them up. Map from (minScore, maxScore) to (-1, 1)
minScore: Use above algorithm, ranked by lowest weights first
maxScore: Use above algorithm, ranked by highest weights first

Scale
------------
Score: Map answer from (minScore, maxScore) to (-1, 1), then multiply by the weight
minScore: 0
maxScore: Max value


To get the total score for a domain (on a scale of 0 to 1):
Add up all values (between -1 & 1) for the domain. Divide this by the # of questions. Divide by 2. Add 0.5
